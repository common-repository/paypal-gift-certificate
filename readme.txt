= IMPORTANT - PayPal no longer supports Gift Certificates =
PayPal has recently started to move away from supporting Gift Certificates - however they have not provided any information on their site about this.

Therefore it is not recommended to use this plugin or others like it. I talked to PayPal on the phone about this and they said that Gift Certificate money left over in accounts will be returned to the buyers account within 6 months. If you have any questions, please contact PayPal directly.
